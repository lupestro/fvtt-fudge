# Fudge system for FoundryVTT

## 1.0.1    Incorporate issues raised in private playtest
- [FEATURE] Clicking item names brings up item sheets
- [BUGFIX] Dropdown display collapsed to nothing when narrowing actor sheet
- [BUGFIX] Addressed usability issues with edit areas
- [BUGFIX] Removed vestiges of unimplemented feature for simple actors

## 1.0.0    Initial public release - basic Fudge
Everything you should need to play a game using subjective character creation.
- [FEATURE] Standard Fudge character sheet - Drag items onto sheet for traits and equipment. Click die next to attribute or skill to roll.
- [FEATURE] Rolled results automatically apply modifiers for levels and wounds and are expressed as names.
- [FEATURE] Compendia provide all the traits defined by Fantasy Fudge.
- [FEATURE] Choose to use standard or extended trait levels

## What isn't yet available in the current release:

  - Character traits:
    - **strength / mass / speed scale.**
    - powers as separate from gifts.
    - mechanism for supplying custom traits.
  - Character creation:
    - **5-point Fudge.**
    - objective character creation.
    - sample equipment.
    - sample actors.
  - Combat flow: 
    - **assessing combat exchanges to apply wounds.**
    - wound bar on resources
  - Character development:
    - **basic EP management** 
    - variants specified in SRD

For now, these need to be managed by hand but none of them should outright prevent play. 
* If you need to use scale, it may require adjusting rolls appearing in chat in order to compare them across species. 
* The others should have little to no impact during play. T
* The ones in bold (first in each list) have my attention as the next things to tackle, though, for good reason.

Once the base system is relatively complete, our vision is to support specific Fudge-based systems as modules, provided we get the right licensing to do it.
