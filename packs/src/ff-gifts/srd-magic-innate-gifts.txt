Dowsing: you can find water in the earth.
Eagle Eyes: you can see things clearly at a great distance.
Fire-Starter: you can create fire, though not control it. That is, you can cause something flammable to burst into flames (takes three combat rounds for small items), but can’t make fireballs or direct the fire to spread in a given direction.
Fortune Telling: you can see a possible future, as through a glass, darkly. This only works on others, and never on events which are important to you — your own future is always obscured.
Green Thumb: plants respond extraordinarily well to you, with increased growth, health, and production.
Healing Hands: you can heal one level of wounds with a touch. This takes one minute and is fatiguing (see Hedge Magic, below, for fatigue effects).
Second Sight: you can see through illusions and “read” general personalities. You can’t read minds or know any details of personality, but you’ll know who to trust if you concentrate.
Shapeshifter: you can change into one GM-approved animal or plant form. It takes three combat rounds to change fully, during which you are defenseless. [Costs two Gifts]
